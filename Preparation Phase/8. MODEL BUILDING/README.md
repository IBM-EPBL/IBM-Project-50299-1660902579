# Model Building
### Start building Machine Learning Model

There are several Machine Learning algorithms to be used depending on the data you are going to process such as images, sound, text, and numerical values. The algorithms can be chosen according to the objective. As the dataset which we are using is a Classification dataset  we can use the following algorithms,


1. Logistic Regression


2. Random Forest Regression / Classification


3. Decision Tree Regression / Classification


4. K-Nearest Neighbors


5. Support Vector Machine


In order to get appropriate predictions, the dataset can be trained with any of the above algorithms.
