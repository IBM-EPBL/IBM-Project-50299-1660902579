# Data Pre-Processing
In this milestone, we will be pre-processing the dataset that is collected.

### Pre-processing includes

1. Handling the null values.


2. Handling the categorical values if any.


3. Normalize the data if required.


4. Identifying the dependent and independent variables.


5. Split the dataset into train and test sets.
