# Pre-Requisites

## In order to develop this project we need to install the following software/packages:
### Step 1:

#### Anaconda Navigator :


Anaconda Navigator is a free and open-source distribution of the Python and R programming languages for data science and machine learning related applications. It can be installed on Windows, Linux, and macOS. Conda is an open-source, cross-platform,  package management system. Anaconda comes with great tools like JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebook, QtConsole, Spyder, Glueviz, Orange, Rstudio, Visual Studio Code.


For this project, we will be using Jupyter notebook and Spyder

### Step 2:


#### To build Machine learning models you must require the following packages


1. Sklearn: Scikit-learn is a library in Python that provides many unsupervised and supervised learning algorithms.


2. NumPy: NumPy is a Python package that stands for 'Numerical Python'. It is the core library for scientific computing, which contains a powerful n-dimensional array object  


3. Pandas: pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible, and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool,built on top of the Python programming language. 


4. Matplotlib: It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits


5. Flask: Web framework used for building Web applications.

#### If you are using anaconda navigator, follow below steps to download required packages:


Open anaconda prompt.


1. Type “pip install numpy” and click enter.


2. Type “pip install pandas”and click enter.


3. Type “pip install matplotlib”and click enter.


4. Type“pip install scikit-learn”and click enter.


5. Type“pip install Flask”and click enter.


#### If you are using Pycharm IDE, you can install the packages through the command prompt and follow the same syntax as above.
